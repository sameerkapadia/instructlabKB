The  office  of  president  was  created  when  India became  a  republic  on  [26  January  1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Day_\(India\))  when  [its constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India)  came  into  force.  The  president  is [indirectly elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_election) by an [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(India\)) comprising both  houses  of  the  [Parliament  of  India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India)  and  the [legislative  assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Legislative_Assembly_\(India\))  of  each  of  [India's  states  and territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India), who themselves are all [directly elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directly_elected) by the citizens.

[Article 53](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Article_53_{Executive_power_of_the_Union}) of the [Constitution of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India) states that the president  can  exercise  their  powers  directly  or  by subordinate  authority,  though  all  of  the  executive powers  vested  in  the  president  are,  in  practice, exercised by the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India) heading the [Council of  Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers).[\[3\]](#_page17_x26.25_y225.75)  The  president  is  bound  by  the

**Origin![ref1]**

India achieved independence from the British on [15 August  1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_\(India\)),  initially  as  a  [dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion)  within  the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) with [George VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI) as king, represented in the country by a [governor-general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India).[\[4\] ](#_page17_x26.25_y282.75)Following independence, the [Constituent Assembly of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_India),  under  the  leadership  of  [B.  R.  Ambedkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar), undertook the process of drafting a completely new constitution for the country. The [Constitution of India ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India)was  eventually  enacted  on  26  November  1949  and came  into  force  on  26  January  1950,[\[5\]](#_page17_x26.25_y339.75): 26   making India  a  [republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic).[\[6\]](#_page17_x26.25_y396.75): 9   The  offices  of  monarch  and

**Powers and duties![ref1]**

Under the draft constitution the President occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution. He is the head of the state but not of the Executive. He represents the Nation  but  does  not  rule  the  Nation.  He  is  the  symbol  of  the  Nation.  His  place  in  the administration is that of a ceremonial device on a seal by which the nation's decisions are made known.

**Duty**

The primary duty of the president is to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and the law of India as made part of their [oath](#_page9_x7.50_y609.75) (Article 60 of Indian constitution).[\[8\]](#_page17_x26.25_y510.75) The president is the common head of all

independent constitutional entities. All their actions, [recommendations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Judges_Cases) ([Article 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_One_of_the_Constitution_of_India), Article 111, Article

274, etc.) and supervisory powers ([Article 74(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_74_\(Constitution_of_India\)), Article 78C, Article 108, Article 111, etc.) over the executive and legislative entities of India shall be used in accordance to uphold the constitution.[\[11\]](#_page18_x26.25_y259.50) There

is no bar on the actions of the president to contest in the court of law.[\[12\]](#_page18_x26.25_y316.50)

**Legislative powers**

Legislative power is constitutionally vested in the [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) of which the president is the head, to  facilitate  the  lawmaking  process  per  the  constitution  (Article  78, Article  86,  etc.).  The  president summons both the houses ([Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) and [Rajya Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha)) of the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) and prorogues them. They can

[dissolve the Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament).[\[5\]](#_page17_x26.25_y339.75): 147 

The president inaugurates parliament by addressing it after the general elections and also at the beginning of the first session every year per Article 87(1). The presidential address on these occasions is generally meant to outline the new policies of the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India).[\[13\]](#_page18_x26.25_y387.00): 145 

All [bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_\(proposed_law\)) passed by the parliament can become laws only after receiving the assent of the president per [Article 111](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V). After a bill is presented to them, the president shall declare either that they assent to the Bill, or that they withhold assent from it. As a third option, they can return a bill to parliament, if it is not a [money bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_bill), for reconsideration. President may be of the view that a particular bill passed under the [legislative  powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawmaking_procedure_in_India)  of  parliament  is  violating  the  constitution,  they  can  send  back  the  bill  with  their recommendation to pass the bill under the constituent powers of parliament following the [Article 368 ](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XX)procedure. When, after reconsideration, the bill is passed accordingly and presented to the president, with or  without  amendments,  the  president  cannot  withhold  their  assent  from  it.  The  president  can  also withhold their assent to a bill when it is initially presented to them (rather than return it to parliament) thereby exercising a [pocket veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_veto) on the advice of the prime minister or council of ministers per[ Article 74](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V)

if it is inconsistent with the constitution.[\[12\]](#_page18_x26.25_y316.50) Article 143 gives the president the power to consult the [supreme court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) about the constitutional validity of an issue. The president shall assent to [constitutional amendment bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India) without power to withhold the bills per[ Article 368 (2)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XX).

When either of the two Houses of the [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) is not in session, and if the government feels the need for an immediate procedure, the president can promulgate ordinances that have the same force and effect as an act passed by parliament under its legislative powers. These are in the nature of interim or temporary legislation and their continuance is subject to parliamentary approval. Ordinances remain valid  for  no  more  than  six  weeks  from  the  date  the  parliament  is  convened  unless  approved  by  it earlier.[\[14\]](#_page18_x26.25_y430.50) Under [Article 123](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V), the president as the upholder of the constitution shall be satisfied that

immediate  action  is  mandatory  as  advised  by  the  union  cabinet  and  they  are  confident  that  the government commands majority support in the parliament needed for the passing of the ordinance into an act and parliament can be summoned to deliberate on the passing of the ordinance as soon as possible. The promulgated ordinance is treated as an act of parliament when in force and it is the responsibility of the president to withdraw the ordinance as soon as the reasons for the promulgation of the ordinance are no  longer  applicable.  Bringing  laws  in  the  form  of  ordinances  has  become  a  routine  matter  by  the government and president, but the provisions made in Article 123 are meant for mitigating unusual circumstances where immediate action is inevitable when the extant provisions of the law are inadequate. Re-promulgation of an ordinance after failing to get approval within the stipulated time of both houses of

parliament is an unconstitutional act by the president.[\[15\]](#_page18_x26.25_y501.00) The president should not incorporate any matter in  an  ordinance  which  violates  the  constitution  or  requires  an  amendment  to  the  constitution.  The

president should take moral responsibility when an ordinance elapses automatically or is not approved by the parliament or violates the constitution.[\[16\]](#_page18_x26.25_y598.50) Thus, it is believed that the POI is the [de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure) head of the

state, whereas [PM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India) is the [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) head.

**Executive powers**

The President of the Indian Union will be generally bound by the advice of his Ministers. ... He can do nothing contrary to their advice nor can do anything without their advice. The [President of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) can dismiss any Secretary at any time. The President of the Indian Union has no power to do so, so long as his Ministers command a majority in [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India)

As per [Article 53](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V), the [executive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_\(government\)) of the country is vested in the president and is exercised by the president either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the constitution. When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president  per  [Article  70](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V)  which  may  be  further  delegated  by  the president to the [governors of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_of_states_of_India) per [Article 160](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_VI). [Union cabinet ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers)with [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India) as its head, should aid and advise the president in performing their functions. Per [Article 74 (2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_74_of_the_Constitution_of_India), the council of ministers or prime minister are not accountable legally to the advice tendered to the president but it is the sole responsibility of the president to ensure

The  President  may  dismiss  a  judge  with  a  two-thirds  vote  of  the  two  Houses  of  the parliament.[\[18\]](#_page19_x26.25_y0.00)

The [Indian government's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India) chief legal adviser, [Attorney-General for India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney-General_for_India), is appointed by the president of India under Article 76(1) and holds office during the pleasure of the president. If the president considers a question of law or a matter of public importance has arisen, they can also ask for the [advisory opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion#India) of the [supreme court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) per [Article 143](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Article_143_{Power_of_President_to_consult_Supreme_Court}). Per [Article 88](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V), the president can ask the attorney general to attend the parliamentary proceedings and report to him any unlawful functioning if any.[\[19\]](#_page19_x26.25_y70.50)

**Diplomatic powers**

All international treaties and agreements are negotiated and concluded on behalf of the president.[\[26\]](#_page19_x26.25_y523.50): 18 However, in practice, such negotiations are usually carried out by the prime minister along with their Cabinet (especially the [Minister of External Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_\(India\))). Also, such treaties are subject to the approval of the

parliament. The president represents India in international forums and affairs where such a function is chiefly ceremonial. The president may also send and receive diplomats, i.e. the officers from the [Indian Foreign Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Foreign_Service).[\[27\]](#_page19_x26.25_y580.50): 143  The president is the first citizen of the country.[\[21\]](#_page19_x26.25_y184.50)

The president can declare three types of emergencies: national, state and financial, under articles 352, 356 & 360 in addition to promulgating ordinances under article 123.[\[26\]](#_page19_x26.25_y523.50): 12 

**National emergency**

A national emergency can be declared in the whole of India or a part of its territory for causes of war or armed rebellion or an external aggression. Such an emergency was declared in India in 1962 ([Indo-China war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War)), 1971 ([Indo-Pakistan war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971)),[\[30\]](#_page20_x26.25_y70.50) and 1975 to 1977 (declared by [Indira Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi)).[\[see main\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_\(India\))

Under[ Article 352](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XVIII) of the India constitution, the president can declare such an emergency only on the basis of a written request by the cabinet of ministers headed by the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India). Such a proclamation must be approved by the parliament with at least a two-thirds majority within one month. Such an emergency can be imposed for six months. It can be extended by six months by repeated parliamentary approval-

there is no maximum duration.[\[26\]](#_page19_x26.25_y523.50)

In such an emergency, [Fundamental Rights of Indian citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Rights_in_India) can be suspended.[\[5\]](#_page17_x26.25_y339.75): 33  The six freedoms under [Right to Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_Rights,_Directive_Principles_and_Fundamental_Duties_of_India#Right_to_Freedom) are automatically suspended. However, the Right to Life and Personal Liberty

cannot be suspended ([Article 21](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_III#Article_21_{Protection_of_life_and_personal_liberty})).[\[31\]](#_page20_x26.25_y127.50): 20.6 

The president can make laws on the 66 subjects of the State List (which contains subjects on which the state  governments  can  make  laws).[\[32\]](#_page20_x26.25_y184.50)  Also,  all  money  bills  are  referred  to  the  president  for

approval.[\[33\]](#_page20_x26.25_y241.50): 88  The term of the [Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) can be extended by a period of up to one year, but not so as to extend the term of parliament beyond six months after the end of the declared emergency.[\[20\]](#_page19_x26.25_y127.50): 223 National Emergency has been proclaimed 3 times in India to date. It was declared first in 1962 by President [Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarvepalli_Radhakrishnan), during the [Sino-Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War). This emergency lasted through the [Indo- Pakistani War of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965) and up to 1968. It was revoked in 1968. The second emergency in India was proclaimed in 1971 by President [V. V. Giri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._V._Giri) on the eve of the [Indo-Pakistani War of 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971). The first two emergencies were in the face of external aggression and War. They were hence external emergencies. Even as the second emergency was in progress, another internal emergency was proclaimed by President [Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhruddin_Ali_Ahmed), with [Indira Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi) as prime minister in 1975. In 1977, the second and the third emergencies were together revoked.

**State emergency**

If the president is not fully satisfied, on the basis of the report of the governor of the concerned state or from other sources, that the governance in a state cannot be carried out according to the provisions in the constitution, they can proclaim under Article 356 a state of emergency in the state.[\[8\]](#_page17_x26.25_y510.75) Such an emergency must be approved by the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) within a period of 2 months.

Under [Article 356](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XVIII) of the [Indian constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India), it can be imposed from six months to a maximum period of three  years  with  repeated  parliamentary  approval  every  six  months.  If  the  emergency  needs  to  be extended for more than three years, this can be achieved by a [constitutional amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India), as has happened in [Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India) and [Jammu and Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_\(union_territory\)).

During such an emergency, the president can take over the entire work of the executive, and the governor administers the state in the name of the president. The Legislative Assembly can be dissolved or may remain in suspended animation. The parliament makes laws on the 66 subjects of the state list[\[34\]](#_page20_x26.25_y298.50) (see [National emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_in_India) for explanation).

A State Emergency can be imposed via the following:

1. By Article 356 – If that state failed to run constitutionally, i.e. constitutional machinery has failed. When a state emergency is imposed under this provision, the state is said to be under "[President's rule.\[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_rule)5[\]: 15](#_page20_x26.25_y355.50)9 
1. By Article 365 – If that state is not working according to the direction of the Union government issued per the provisions of the constitution.[36]

This  type  of  emergency  needs  the  approval  of  the  parliament  within  2  months.  It  can  last  up  to  a maximum of three years via extensions after each 6-month period. However, after one year it can be extended only if

1. A state of National Emergency has been declared in the country or the particular state.
1. The Election Commission finds it difficult to organise an election in that state.

The [Sarkaria Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarkaria_Commission) held that presidents have unconstitutionally misused the provision of Article 356 many times for achieving political motives, by dismissing the state governments although there was no constitutional break down in the states.[\[37\]](#_page20_x26.25_y483.00) During 2005, President's rule was imposed in [Bihar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar) state,

misusing Article 356 unconstitutionally to prevent the democratically elected state legislators to form a government after the state elections.

There is no provision in the constitution to re-promulgate president's rule in a state when the earlier promulgation ceased to operate for want of parliaments approval within two months duration. During 2014 in Andhra Pradesh, president's rule was first imposed on 1 March 2014 and it ceased to operate on

30 April  2014.  President's  rule  was  promulgated  after  being  fully  aware  that  the  earliest  parliament session  is  feasible  at  the  end  of  May  2014  after  the  general  elections.  It  was  reimposed  again unconstitutionally on 28 April 2014 by the president.[\[38\]](#_page20_x26.25_y540.00)[\[39\]](#_page20_x26.25_y597.00)

**Financial emergency**

Article 282 accords financial autonomy in spending the financial resources available with the states for public purposes.[\[8\]](#_page17_x26.25_y510.75)[\[40\]](#_page20_x26.25_y667.50) [Article 293](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XII) gives liberty to states to borrow without any limit to its ability for its

requirements within the territory of India without any consent from the Union government. However, the Union government can insist on compliance with its loan terms when a state has an outstanding loan charged to the consolidated fund of India or an outstanding loan in respect of which a guarantee has been given by the Government of India under the liability of consolidated fund of India.[\[41\]](#_page21_x26.25_y0.00)

Under article 360 of the constitution, the president can proclaim a financial emergency when the financial stability  or  credit  of  the  nation  or  any  part  of  its  territory  is  threatened.[\[8\]](#_page17_x26.25_y510.75)  However,  until  now  no

guidelines defining the situation of financial emergency in the entire country or a state or union territory or a panchayat or a municipality or a corporation have been framed either by the [finance commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Commission_of_India) or by the central government.

Such an emergency must be approved by the parliament within two months by a simple majority. It has never been declared.[\[42\]](#_page21_x26.25_y57.00): 604  A state of financial emergency remains in force indefinitely until revoked by the president.[\[20\]](#_page19_x26.25_y127.50): 195 

The president can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the [supreme court ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India)and [ high  courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_high_courts_in_India),  in  cases  of  a  financial  emergency. All  money  bills  passed  by  state  legislatures  are submitted to the president for approval. They can direct the state to observe certain principles (economy measures) relating to financial matters.[\[43\]](#_page21_x26.25_y127.50)

**Selection process![ref2]**

**Eligibility**

[Article 58](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Article_58_{Qualifications_for_election_as_President}) of the [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India) sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president must be:

- a [citizen of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law)
- of 35 years of age or above
- qualified to become a member of the Lok[ Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha)

A  person  shall  not  be  eligible  for  election  as  president  if  they  hold  any  [office  of  profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_profit)  under  the Government of India or the Government of any State or any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said Governments.

Certain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates. These are:

- The current [Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_India)
- The governor of any state
- A Minister of the Union or of any state (including [prime minister and ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India)chief[ ministers)\[20\]: 72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_\(India\))[ ](#_page19_x26.25_y127.50)

In the event that the vice president, a state governor or a minister is elected president, they are considered to have vacated their previous office on the date they begin serving as president.

A member of parliament or a State Legislature can seek election to the office of the president but if they are elected as president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in parliament or State Legislature on the date on which they enter upon their office as President **[Article 59(1)]**.

**Article 57** provides that a person who holds, or who has held, office as president shall, subject to the other provisions of this constitution, be eligible for re-election to that office.

Under the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952,[\[44\]](#_page21_x26.25_y184.50) a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on

the [ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot).[\[45\]](#_page21_x26.25_y268.50)

**Time of election![ref3]**

Article 56(1) of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office for a term of five years, from the date on which they enter their office. According to Article 62, an election to fill a vacancy caused by the expiration of the term of office of President shall be completed before the expiration of the term. An election to fill a vacancy in the office of President occurring by reason of their death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held as soon as possible after, and in no case later than six months from, the date of occurrence of the vacancy; and the person elected to fill the vacancy shall, subject to the provisions of Article 56, be entitled to hold office for the full term of five years from the date on which they enter their office.

To meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.

**Conditions for the presidency**

Certain conditions, per [Article 59](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Article_59_{Conditions_of_President's_office}) of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections. The conditions are:

- The president shall not be a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state, and if a member of either house of the parliament or a house of the legislature of any state is elected president, they shall be deemed to have vacated their seat in that house on the date on which they enter into office as president.
- The president shall not hold any other office of profit.
- The president shall be entitled without payment of rent to the use of their official residences and shall be also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by parliament by law and until provision in that behalf is so made, such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are specified in the Second Schedule.
- The emoluments and allowances of the president shall not be diminished during their term

  of office.[\[42\]:](#_page21_x26.25_y57.00) 170 

**Election process**

Whenever the office becomes vacant, the new president is chosen by an [electoral college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_\(India\)) consisting of the elected  members  of  both  houses  of [ parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India)  ([MPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_\(India\))),  the  elected  members  of  the  State  Legislative Assemblies ([Vidhan Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhan_Sabha)) of all States and the elected members of the legislative assemblies ([MLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_\(India\))) of union territories with legislatures, i.e., [National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), [Jammu and Kashmir ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_\(union_territory\))and [Puducherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puducherry_\(union_territory\)). The election process of the president is a more extensive process than of the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India) who is also elected indirectly (elected by the members of the majority party (or union) in the [Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha)). Whereas President being the constitutional head with duties to protect, defend and preserve the constitution and [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) in a [constitutional democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_democracy) with [constitutional supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouster_clause), is elected in an extensive manner by the members of Lok Sabha, [Rajya Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha) and [state legislative assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidhan_Sabha) in a secret ballot procedure.

The nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of

₹15,000 (US$180) in the [Reserve Bank of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India).[\[46\]](#_page21_x26.25_y325.50) The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.

The election is held by means of the [instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) (IRV) method.[\[47\]](#_page21_x26.25_y396.00) The voting takes place by a [secret ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot) system. The manner of election of President is provided by[ Article 55](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_V#Article_55_{Manner_of_election_of_President}) of the [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India).[\[48\]](#_page21_x26.25_y439.50)

Each elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by Members of parliament equals the total number of votes cast by State Legislators. Also, legislators from larger states cast more votes than those from smaller states. Finally, the number of legislators in state matters; if a state has few legislators, then each legislator has more votes; if a state has many legislators, then each legislator has fewer votes.

The actual calculation for votes cast by a particular state is calculated by dividing the state's population by 1000, which is divided again by the number of legislators from the State voting in the electoral college. This number is the number of votes per legislator in a given state. Every elected member of the parliament enjoys the same number of votes, which may be obtained by dividing the total number of votes assigned to the members of legislative assemblies by the total number of elected representatives of the parliament.

Although Indian presidential elections involve actual voting by [MPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament) and [MLAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_\(India\)), they tend to vote for the <a name="_page9_x7.50_y609.75"></a>candidate supported by their respective parties.[\[49\]](#_page21_x26.25_y510.00)

**Oath or affirmation**

The president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the [Chief Justice of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India)—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the supreme court—an oath or affirmation to protect, preserve and

defend the constitution as follows:[\[50\]](#_page21_x26.25_y567.00)

I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President (or discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law, and that

I will devote myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of India.

The Supreme Court can remove the president for the electoral malpractices or upon being not eligible to be a member of the [Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) under the [Representation of the People Act, 1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act,_1951).[\[56\]](#_page22_x26.25_y268.50) Subject to Article 71 (3), parliament made

The president may also be removed before the expiry of the term through [impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment) for violating the [Constitution of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India) by the [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament) of India. The process may start in either of the two houses of the [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India). The house initiates the process by levelling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by at least one-quarter of the total members of that house. The notice is sent up to the president and 14 days later, it is taken up for consideration.

A resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the president has the right to defend himself through an authorised [counsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counsel). If the second house also approves the charges made by the special majority again, the president  stands  impeached  and  is  deemed  to  have  vacated  their  office  from  the  date  when  such  a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.[\[58\]](#_page22_x26.25_y382.50)

Under [Article 361](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XIX) of the constitution, though the president cannot be summoned for questioning except on  their  voluntary  willingness  to  testify  in  the  court  in  support  of  their  controversial  deeds,  the unconstitutional decisions taken by the president would be declared invalid by the courts. The case would be decided by the courts based on the facts furnished by the Union government for the president's role. As clarified by the supreme court in the case *Rameshwar Prasad & Others vs Union of India & An Other* on 24 January 2006; though the president cannot be prosecuted and imprisoned during their term of office, they can be prosecuted after he/she steps down from the post for any guilt committed during the term of the presidency as declared earlier by the courts.[\[59\]](#_page22_x26.25_y453.00) No president has resigned on impropriety to continue

No criminal case at least on the grounds of [disrespecting constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Insults_to_National_Honour_Act,_1971) is lodged till now against former presidents to punish them for their unconstitutional acts; though many decisions taken during the term of a president have been declared by the supreme court as unconstitutional, [*mala fides*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mala_fides), void, [*ultra vires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_vires), etc.[\[60\]](#_page22_x26.25_y496.50)

president reverts to their office when a new president is elected and enters office. When the president is unable to act because of absence, illness or any other cause, the vice president discharges the president's functions until the president resumes the duties.

A  vice  president  who  acts  as  or  discharges  the  functions  of  the  president  has  all  the  powers  and immunities  of  the  president  and  is  entitled  to  the  same  emoluments  as  the  president.  When  a  vice president discharges the duties of the president, he/she does not function as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.

The [Indian parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) has enacted the law—*The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969* —[\[61\]](#_page22_x26.25_y567.00) for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and the

vice president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the [chief justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India)—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the [Supreme Court of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) available—discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their  office  or  a  newly  elected  vice  president  begins  to  act  as  president  under  Article  65  of  the constitution, whichever is the earlier.[\[22\]](#_page19_x26.25_y241.50): 96  For example, in 1969, when President [Zakir Husain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Husain_\(politician\)) died in

Office, Vice-President [V. V. Giri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._V._Giri) served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned

from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. In this event, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice [Mohammad Hidayatullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Hidayatullah) served as the acting president of India until the next president was elected.

**Important presidential interventions in the past![ref3]**

The president's role as defender of the constitution and the powers as Head of State, especially in relation to  those  exercised  by  the  prime  minister  as  leader  of  the  government,  have  changed  over  time.  In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.

**Proving majority in the parliament**

In 1979, Prime Minister [Charan Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charan_Singh), did not enjoy a parliamentary majority. He responded to this by simply  not  advising  the  president  to  summon  parliament.[\[21\]](#_page19_x26.25_y184.50)  Since  then,  presidents  have  been  more

diligent in directing incoming Prime Ministers to convene parliament and prove their majority within reasonable deadlines (2 to 3 weeks). In the interim period, the Prime Ministers are generally restrained from making policy decisions.

**Proof of Majority to form a Government**

Since the 1990s, Parliamentary elections have generally not resulted in a single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the [Lok Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha) (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.[\[62\]](#_page22_x26.25_y610.50)[\[63\]](#_page22_x26.25_y681.00)

**Vetoing of a Bill**

Since the Indian constitution does not provide any time limit within which the president is to declare their assent or refusal, the president could exercise a "pocket veto" by not taking any action for an indefinite time. The veto was used in 1986 by President [Zail Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zail_Singh) over the Postal Bill. The president did not give assent to the bill, arguing that its scope was too sweeping and would give the government [arbitrary powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_power) to intercept postal communications indiscriminately.[\[58\]](#_page22_x26.25_y382.50)[\[64\]](#_page23_x26.25_y0.00)[\[65\]](#_page23_x26.25_y57.00)

**Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués**

In the late 1990s, President [K. R. Narayanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._R._Narayanan) introduced a modicum of transparency and openness in the functioning of the President. This was by means of Rashtrapati Bhavan Communiqués explaining, to the nation,  the  thinking  that  led  to  the  various  decisions  he  took  while  exercising  their  discretionary powers.[\[66\]](#_page23_x26.25_y114.00)

**Return of a Bill**

The constitution gives the president the power to return a bill unsigned but it circumscribes the power to send it back only once for reconsideration. If the parliament sends back the bill with or without changes, the president is obliged to sign it. In mid-2006, President [A. P. J. Abdul Kalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam) sent back a controversial bill regarding the exclusion of certain offices from the scope of 'offices of profit', the holding of which would disqualify a person from being a member of parliament.[\[67\]](#_page23_x26.25_y184.50) The combined opposition, the [NDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance_\(India\)),

hailed the move. The UPA chose to send the bill back to the president without any changes and, after 17 days, Kalam gave his assent on 18 August 2006.[\[68\]](#_page23_x26.25_y241.50)[\[69\]](#_page23_x26.25_y325.50)

**Sacking state governors**

[Arunachal Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh) governor [Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyoti_Prasad_Rajkhowa), who was earlier appointed by the ruling party at the centre,  was  sacked  by  President  [Pranab  Mukherjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranab_Mukherjee)  after  the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  his unconstitutional acts.[\[70\]](#_page23_x26.25_y396.00)
